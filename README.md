# Final-Project-Database1
My final project for Database 1 class at IFPR.

The project context is a clothing store, and I made it to handle information related to sales, purchases and general data about the customer and the supplier. I used MySQL Workbench, you can see the script I made manually in the .sql file.

I did the database modeling too, below we have more information about the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
